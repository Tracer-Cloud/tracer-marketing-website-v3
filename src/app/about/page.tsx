      About Tracer
      Tracer is an advanced observability platform for high-performance computing (HPC) systems in regulated industries. We help scientists and engineers to run, maintain, and optimize supercomputing software solutions.

      Our Moonshot
      Just as cloud computing revolutionized web and mobile applications over the past 10 years, we believe it's time for scientists and engineers to experience a similar transformation, and get their turn to ask: "what can I do with all this immense power?"

      The Best of Two Worlds
      Founded in 2023 by Vincent Hus and Laura Bogaert, Tracer combines deep technical expertise with sharp business acumen. Vincent, an expert in software and biomechanical engineering, and Laura, a McKinsey alum specializing in bioinformatics and pharma, are the perfect storm of innovation. Together they joined forces to drive the next wave of computational infrastructure and create the world's first verticalized observability platform.

      Transforming High-Tech Industries
      We started in bioinformatics, but quickly realized our technology is the skeleton key for unlocking efficiency across all HPC environments. We're not just improving existing systems; we're accelerating entire industries:

      Life Sciences: Accelerating R&D and enabling digital drug discovery
      Aerospace: Optimizing aerodynamics and propulsion for advanced designs
      Semiconductors: Advancing chip architecture and manufacturing processes
      Automotive: Enhancing vehicle performance, safety, and innovation
      Manufacturing: Streamlining product development and production efficiencies
      Impossible? Not If We Do It Together!
      The next decade will see computational power do for physical sciences what the internet did for information. At Tracer, we're not just observers of this change â€“ we're the catalysts. We're on the lookout for bold, brilliant minds who aren't afraid to challenge the status quo and push the boundaries of what's possible.
