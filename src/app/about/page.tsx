        <p className="mb-4">
          Just as cloud computing revolutionized web and mobile applications over the past 10 years, we believe it&apos;s time for scientists and engineers to experience a similar transformation, and get their turn to ask: &quot;what can I do with all this immense power?&quot;

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">The Best of Two Worlds</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Founded in 2023 by Vincent Hus and Laura Bogaert, Tracer combines deep technical expertise with sharp business acumen. Vincent, an expert in software and biomechanical engineering, and Laura, a McKinsey alum specializing in bioinformatics and pharma, are the perfect storm of innovation. Together they joined forces to drive the next wave of computational infrastructure and create the world&apos;s first verticalized observability platform.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Impossible? Not If We Do It Together!</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The next decade will see computational power do for physical sciences what the internet did for information. At Tracer, we&apos;re not just observers of this change â€“ we&apos;re the catalysts. We&apos;re on the lookout for bold, brilliant minds who aren&apos;t afraid to challenge the status quo and push the boundaries of what&apos;s possible.
