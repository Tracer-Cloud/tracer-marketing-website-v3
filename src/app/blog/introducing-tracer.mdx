# Introducing Tracer: Enterprise Observability for Computational Biology

We're excited to introduce Tracer, a new observability platform designed specifically for computational biology workflows.

## The Problem

Computational biology pipelines are becoming increasingly complex, with multiple tools, dependencies, and data sources. When something goes wrong, it can be difficult to identify the root cause, leading to wasted time and resources.

## Our Solution

Tracer provides real-time monitoring and observability for your computational biology workflows, helping you:

- **Identify bottlenecks** in your pipelines
- **Debug errors** quickly and efficiently
- **Optimize resource usage** to reduce costs
- **Track data lineage** across your workflows

## Key Features

- **Real-time monitoring** of pipeline execution
- **Detailed metrics** for each tool and step
- **Error tracking** with contextual information
- **Resource usage analysis** to identify optimization opportunities
- **Integration with popular workflow managers** like Nextflow, Snakemake, and more

## Getting Started

Getting started with Tracer is easy. Just copy our one-line installation script:

```bash
curl -sSL https://setup.tracer.cloud | bash -s -- <YOUR_API_KEY> && . ~/.bashrc && tracer help
```

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to develop Tracer!
