    question: "Do you run the pipelines for me?",
    answer:
      "We are not a workflow automation company or no-code solutions. At Tracer, we believe that as scientific companies are turning into software companies, scientists are becoming software engineers. They want ultimate flexibility to run their pipelines where they want and in whatever configuration they want. Tracer runs in the background as part of any pipeline you run, similar to observability for cloud engineering. We provide a dashboard to know what is happening in real time for monitoring and insights at all levels of the organisation.",
