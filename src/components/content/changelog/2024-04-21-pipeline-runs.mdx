## Release v0.0.4 on April 21st - Individual Pipeline Runs and 1-line-of-code Integration

- Once you click on a pipeline you will see a list of all the runs for that pipeline
- Previously it was only possible to see aggregrate data for all pipeline runs, but now you can drill down into the details of each run
- We've also added a one line of code integration method. If you go to the setup page to create a new API key, you can copy the code snippet and paste it into your terminal to start sending data to Tracer

### What's Next?

- We're working on a client library that will make it possible to send results from your pipeline runs to Tracer
- We're also working on an improved division of metrics between all pipeline runs, individual runs and tools
- Based on user conversations we're thinking about introducing more governance features, such as the ability to organize pipelines into projects and team workspaces
