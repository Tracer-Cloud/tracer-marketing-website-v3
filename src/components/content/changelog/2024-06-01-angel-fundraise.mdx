# Tracer Secures Oversubscribed Angel Round for Biology Observability

We’re pretty excited to announce that just 10 weeks after we began coding, Tracer
has raised an angel round of financing that's been 3x oversubscribed.

This round, supported by a stellar lineup of biotechnology executives and cloud infrastructure investors, underscores confidence in our vision to create the foundational layer for biology DevOps, which is crucial for accelerating the biology revolution in society.

Thank you for joining us on this journey. Here’s to a future where biology software is robust, fast, and many times better.

With ❤ from the Tracer team
