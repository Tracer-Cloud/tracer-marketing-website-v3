# Upcoming Auto-Instrumentation and Error Database Releases

With our coffers replenished, it’s time to step on the gas and accelerate our progress towards Tracer's biggest upcoming releases yet

In July, we will eliminate the need for elevated security permissions within enterprise environments, and provide auto-instrumentation to enable the use of Tracer without changing your code.

Then, in August, we will release Version 0.1 of our error database, which is set to dramatically reduce the time that it takes to fix errors in bioinformatics. Here’s a full overview of what we’re working on:

### July release: Auto-instrumentation

1. **Automatic instrumentation** - no more changes needed to your code providing an instant time to value
2. **Self-service enterprise enablement** – we’re removing the need for super user (root) access requirements
3. **10x faster query engine** – we’re improving our queries to be 10x faster and enable far more detailed searches across any unit of computation (tools, datasets, teams, users)
4. **OpenTelemetry data standardisation** – future proofing compatibility with platforms like DataDog and Grafana, enabling seamless export and integration with Tracer

### August release: Error database for faster troubleshooting

1. **V0.1 Error database** – initially for RNA-seq tools and pipelines, progressing towards our aim to fix bioinformatics errors 4x faster by December 2025
2. **Parameter optimization** — finetune your bioinformatics tools and rightsize your high performance computing clusters for speed and cost efficiency
3. **Teams and workspaces** - to enable you to share computations and reports with your colleagues
4. **Testing of R bioconductor and AlphaFold** – we’re rigorously testing our architecture to be broadly applicable as a foundational layer for biology DevOps and make changes where necessary
