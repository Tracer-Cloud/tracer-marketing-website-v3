## Release v0.0.23: eBPF Tracepoint Integration for improved Kernel-level System Monitoring

We are thrilled to announce the integration of an improved eBPF program integration into our platform, enabling kernel-level tracing to enhance your system monitoring capabilities.

### New Features

- **eBPF Program Integration**: Seamlessly load and run eBPF programs directly from our Rust-based daemon for deep system insights.
- **Syscall Tracing**: Gain real-time visibility into process creation by tracing the `execve` syscall.
- **Efficient Multi-CPU Event Handling**: Process eBPF events across multiple CPUs for optimal performance.
- **Granular Process Insights**: Capture and analyze short-lived processes that might be missed by traditional polling methods.

### Benefits

- Deeper visibility into system behavior with kernel-level insights
- Reduced monitoring overhead on your systems
- Real-time notifications about new process executions
- Improved security monitoring with immediate process creation alerts
- Enhanced performance analysis capabilities

We can't wait to hear your thoughts on this powerful new integration. Happy monitoring!
