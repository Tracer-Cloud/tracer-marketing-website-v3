## Our Role and Exciting Opportunity

As part of the BioTech track, Tracer.bio will be presenting a unique challenge for participants. Most importantly, this hackathon presents an unprecedented opportunity for us to test drive our Tracer platform with up to 100 scientists. This large-scale, real-world testing environment is invaluable for gathering feedback, identifying potential improvements, and showcasing the capabilities of our platform.

## Why This Matters

1. **Real-world Testing**: Observing how 100 scientists interact with our platform in a high-pressure, time-constrained environment will provide insights that are difficult to obtain through traditional testing methods.

2. **Feedback from Diverse Users**: The hackathon will attract participants from various backgrounds and expertise levels, giving us a broad spectrum of user feedback.

3. **Potential for Collaboration**: Events like these are hotbeds for innovation. We're excited about the potential collaborations and ideas that might emerge from this hackathon.

4. **Showcasing Our Capabilities**: This is an excellent opportunity to demonstrate the power and versatility of the Tracer platform to a highly relevant audience.
