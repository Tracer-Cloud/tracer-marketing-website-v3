## How to use Tracer's shell script commands as part of your workflow

Tracer has a number of CLI (command line interface) commands which are used to track and monitor in real time different metadata such as packages or tools in your bioinformatics pipelines
{/* Built with Rust, you can easily install it in your terminal using our open-source installation script, available during signup. */}

<Steps>

### Label a new run with `tracer start`

This command indicates the start of a new run. Copy it into your script below the shebang.

```bash
tracer start
```

### Label the start of a tool with `tracer tool`

Before you start a tool (e.g., STAR, bam), use the `tracer tool` command. This way, the platform can start recording the computational usage of this tool. The `tracer tool` command can be copied into the script as many times as you want.

The `tracer tool` command expects a name under `XX` and a version of the tool under `YY`. An example is:

```bash
tracer tool STAR v2.7.2
```

You can write whatever you find suitable for the name and version.

### Log customized messages with `tracer log`

On top of recording the start and stop of your tools, Tracer is also able to generate messages or 'logs' while your pipeline is running with the `tracer log` command. Tracer allows for whatever message you want, which will be displayed under the flowsheet of your run and in your terminal.

An example of this could be:

```bash
tracer log "The pipeline has finished tool 3 out of 5"
```

The `tracer log` command can be copied into the script as many times as you like or not at all.

### End the run with `tracer end`

At the end of the script, it is important to write the `tracer end` command. This signals the end of the run and stops the tracking of computational usage of the run and tools.

If you forget to write the end command, donâ€™t worry, as the Tracer platform will automatically start a new run once it sees the `tracer start` again.

### Check all commands with `tracer help`

You can find the list of tools by copying the command below into your terminal:

```bash
tracer help
```

The command will give you the following output:
