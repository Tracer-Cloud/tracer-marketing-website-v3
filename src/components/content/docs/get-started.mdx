Copy the following snippet, save the file as "file_name.sh" and run it as a bash script in your terminal with "bash ./file_name.sh"

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# start a new run
tracer start

# record the execution of a tool
tracer tool helloworld_tool v1

# Print "Hello World"

# Log anything such as the script progress
tracer log "you are halfway the script"

# record the execution of another tool
tracer tool welcome v1
