# Introduction

Tracer is the computational biology monitoring platform that boosts productivity with intelligent logging wrappers to diagnose issues, optimize pipeline costs and speed up computations.

Set up Tracer in 4 clicks, then quickly iterate on your workflows with the confidence that your pipelines and data are safeguarded by a reliable error monitoring system.

## Use cases

- **Pipeline Health Monitoring**: <br/>
  Get real-time visiblity in the health of all your pipelines, regardless of programming language or operating system, through a single, integrated dashboard

- **Cost & Performance Analytics**: <br/>Create cost and performance reports across tools, pipeline runs, teams, and projects within a unified data lake for bioinformatics DevOps

- **Advanced Error Traceability**: <br/>Gain insights into the number of runs, failure rates, and failure modes for all your pipelines by matching errors to a comprehensive error database

## How does Tracer work?

We recommend you read the following sections in this order if you are a first-time user of Tracer:

1. Learn about [Runs](/docs/pipelines-and-runs), Tracer's basic unit of computation.
2. Create and track pipelines with [Pipelines](/docs/pipelines-and-runs)
3. Identify computational bottlenecks per tool with [Metrics](/docs/pipelines-and-runs)
4. Learn about Tracer commands with [Bash](/docs/shell-bash.mdx) or [Nextflow](/docs/nextflow) examples
5. Learn about visualising your pipelines with [Flowsheets](/docs/pipelines-and-runs)

## System requirements (as of May 14th 2024)

Tracer is still in alpha and is only available for the following operating systems:

- Linux Ubuntu 22.04 LTS: Recommended platform for optimal performance
- Linux (General): Other Linux distributions are also supported
- macOS: Supported, but with limited metrics functionality
- Windows: Please contact us, we have a compiled binary for Windows, but it is not officially supported
