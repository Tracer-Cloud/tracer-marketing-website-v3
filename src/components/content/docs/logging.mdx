# Logging

Use Tracer to log data from runs, such as tools, results parameter flags or pipeline progress.

The most basic usage is: $tracer log "message" and you can use it to log any message you want to record the results of your pipelines:

<Steps>

### Example: Quality of alignment

Quality of Alignment: After running STAR, it's crucial to log the quality of the alignment. This could include metrics like the percentage of uniquely mapped reads, which is a key indicator of the success of the alignment process.

```bash
# Extract alignment statistics from the STAR log output
ALIGNMENT_STATS=$(grep "Uniquely mapped reads %" "${OUTPUT_DIR}/sample_Log.final.out")
# Log the percentage of uniquely mapped reads
tracer log "Alignment quality for sample_1: ${ALIGNMENT_STATS}"
```

### Example: Read Counting Summary

```bash
# Extract the total number of successfully assigned reads from featureCounts output
TOTAL_COUNTS=$(grep "Assigned" "${OUTPUT_DIR}/counts.txt.summary")
# Log the total number of reads assigned to features
tracer log "Read counting summary for sample_1: ${TOTAL_COUNTS}"
```

### Keep track of results in the UI
