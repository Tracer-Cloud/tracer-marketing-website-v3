### How often are system metrics collected? By default, metrics are collected every

5 seconds and averaged over a 15-second period. If you need higher resolution metrics,
email us a developers@tracer.cloud

### Can I just log metrics, no code or dataset examples?

By default, we don't log any of your dataset examples. You can explicitly turn this feature on to see example predictions in our web interface.
