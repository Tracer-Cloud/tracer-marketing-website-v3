# Open Source

Tracer is built on open source frameworks so to contribute back to the community we have open-sourced our client library project which you can find [here](https://github.com/davincios/tracer-daemon)

Our goals with open source are:

- To establish complete transparency with client libraries and installed software
- To strengthen the open-source community by providing a tool that can be used and modified by anyone
- To collaborate on integrations with various tools and frameworks
- To assure users that Tracer is open and does not impose lock-in, and that production traces are user data that can be exported/fetched at any time
