# Self-Hosting Guide (coming soon)

- [ ] Tracer is designed for the Enterprise requirements of the biopharma and healthcare industries and we understand the importance of data privacy and security for our users
- [ ] We are currently in the early stages of development of building a self-hosting version of Tracer
- [ ] We will be releasing a self-hosting version soon, which just as our one-line-of-code installations, will be deployeable in one line of code on your own cloud infrastructure
- [ ] Instead of sending data to our cloud like common with non healthcare industry monitoring platforms, you will be able to host your own Tracer instance and have full control over your data
